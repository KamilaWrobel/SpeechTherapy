# SpeechTherapy

This is my first "big" project. It is made for Speech therapists. By this program specialists have acces to their customers database, 
they can easily manipulate that. Therapy schedule may help them organize a word days. Most important - they can add a therapy description 
and view old therapies.

It's not fully optimized or finished, but i have learnt a lot while writing this.
